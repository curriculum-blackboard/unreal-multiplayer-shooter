    This <a href="https://github.com/curriculum-blackboard/unreal-multiplayer-shooter/">repository</a> contains a learning project for <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-cpp-multiplayer-shooter/">Unreal Engine 5 C++ Multiplayer Shooter</a> course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We learn all about Unreal Engine multiplayer in this fully comprehensive C++ course. From scratch, we create a complete multiplayer shooter game, capable of creating and joining game sessions and connecting many players across the internet by creating our very own custom plugin that can be added to any Unreal Engine project to easily turn it into a multiplayer game.
    <br/>
    We learn how to optimize our game for the best performance, as competitive shooters require the highest performance possible. We'll implement lag compensation techniques such as client-side prediction and server-side rewind, so the game performs smoothly even in the presence of high lag!
    <br/>
    We learn how to use the proper game classes for each multiplayer mechanic. Custom match states, warmup/cooldown match timers, Elim announcements, HUD with health, shields, ammo and grenades, and more! We keep all important functionality on the server, to prevent cheating, and learn the proper way to use the Player Controller, Game Mode, Game State, Player State, Character and Game Instance classes.
    <br/>
    We make assault rifles, pistols, submachine guns, rocket launchers, grenade launchers, sniper rifles and throwing grenades! All functional in multiplayer, optimized for best performance.
